I'm David Hathaway (git id davidjh78, email david.hathaway.78@gmail.com)

I'm interested in:
- 3D printing, CNC, woodworking, and general "maker" stuff
- math and STEM education
- hiking, snowshoeing, whitewater and sea kayaking

I was an electronic design automation engineer for 32.5 years (1981 to 2014) specializing in static timing analysis, power analysis, and logic synthesis and optimization for IC design.

I'm currently executive director of the Vermont State Mathematics Coalition, and tutor in math and STEM topics in local schools. I also give guest presentations in schools on 3D printing and GPS.

I'm also webmaster and outings chair for the Burlington section of the Green Mountain Club (GMC), and chair of the GMC Trails Maintenance Committee. And I lead trips, teach map & compass navigation, do trail maintenance, and am a corridor monitor GMC.
